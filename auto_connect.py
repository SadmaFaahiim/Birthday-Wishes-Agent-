---------------
Auto LinkedIn Connect module for Birthday Wishes Agent.

Uses birthday wishes as a natural opportunity to grow
your LinkedIn network by sending connection requests to
2nd-degree connections who wished you.

Strategy:
  1. When someone wishes you happy birthday -> check if you're connected
  2. If NOT connected (2nd degree) -> send a personalized connection request
  3. If already connected (1st degree) -> just reply as normal
  4. Smart filtering - only connect with relevant profiles

Connection Request Templates:
  - Personalized, references the birthday wish
  - Feels natural, not spammy
  - Short and warm (LinkedIn limit: 300 characters)

Config:
  AUTO_CONNECT_ENABLED = True/False
  MAX_CONNECTS_PER_DAY = 10  (LinkedIn daily limit safety)

  AUTO-CONNECT INSTRUCTIONS:
  After replying to a birthday wish, check if you are already
  connected with this person on LinkedIn.

  HOW TO CHECK:
    - If their profile shows "1st" -> already connected -> skip
    - If their profile shows "2nd" or "3rd" -> NOT connected -> send request

    - If there's a "Message" button only -> already connected -> skip

  IF NOT CONNECTED (and daily limit not reached):
    1. Click "Connect" on their profile
    2. Select "Add a note"
    3. Write a SHORT, warm connection note (max 300 characters):

       Template options (pick the most natural one):
       a) "Hi [name]! Thank you so much for the birthday wish - really made my day! Would love to connect and stay in touch "

  DAILY LIMIT: You can send {remaining} more connection request(s) today.
  Once the limit is reached -> stop sending requests for today.

  RULES:
     Do NOT connect with accounts that look like spam or bots
     Do NOT connect if the profile seems inactive (no photo, no posts)
     Only connect with real people who sent genuine birthday wishes
     Always add a personalized note - never send a blank request

  GOAL: Find people who wished you happy birthday but are NOT yet

  STEP 1 - Go to https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/
    Look for recent birthday wish messages (from today or yesterday).

  STEP 2 - For each person who sent a birthday wish:
    a) Visit their LinkedIn profile.
    b) Check their connection degree:
       - "1st" -> already connected -> skip
       - "2nd" or "Connect" button -> send request

    c) If NOT connected AND profile looks genuine:
       - Click "Connect"
       - Add a personalized note (max 300 characters):
         "Hi [first name]! Thank you so much for the birthday wish -
          really made my day! Would love to connect and stay in touch "

  STEP 3 - Stop after sending {remaining} request(s) today.
