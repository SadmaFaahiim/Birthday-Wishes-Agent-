----------------
Tone Matching module for Birthday Wishes Agent.

Analyzes how a contact communicates (formal/informal/casual/emoji-heavy)
and adjusts the reply style to match their tone exactly.

How it works:
  1. Reads the contact's message
  2. Detects their communication style
  3. Generates a reply that mirrors their tone

Tone Types:
  - formal      : Professional, full sentences, no emoji
  - semi_formal : Friendly but professional, minimal emoji
  - casual      : Relaxed, contractions, some emoji
  - very_casual : Slang, abbreviations, lots of emoji
  - emoji_heavy : Mostly emoji, very short text

Usage:
    from tone_matching import detect_tone, get_tone_matched_reply
