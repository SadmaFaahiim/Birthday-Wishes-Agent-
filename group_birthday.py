LinkedIn Group Birthday Detection module.

Detects birthday wishes posted in LinkedIn Groups and
responds with a congratulatory group post or comment.

How it works:
  1. Scans LinkedIn Groups the user is a member of
  2. Finds posts where members are wishing someone a birthday
  3. Likes the post and/or adds a warm comment
  4. Optionally sends a direct message to the birthday person

Features:
  - Auto-detects birthday posts in groups
  - Likes and comments on group birthday posts
  - Sends direct wish to the birthday person
  - Tracks all actions in SQLite
  - Daily limit to avoid spam

  GOAL: Find birthday posts in LinkedIn Groups and engage with them.

  STEP 1 - Go to LinkedIn Groups.
    Visit https://www.linkedin.com/groups/
    You will see a list of groups you are a member of.

  STEP 2 - For each group (check up to 5 groups):
    a) Open the group feed.
    b) Look for posts from TODAY that mention a birthday:
       - Posts with "Happy Birthday", "HBD", "", "", ""
       - Posts wishing a specific member
       - Posts with many birthday-related comments

  STEP 3 - For each birthday post found:
    a) Extract the birthday person's name.
    b) Check: have we already engaged with this person in this group today?
       If yes -> skip.

    c) LIKE the post ().
{comment_instruction}
    d) Note the birthday person's name and group for logging.
{dm_instruction}

  STEP 4 - Stop after {remaining} engagement(s) today.

  RULES:
     Only engage with posts from TODAY
     Keep comments warm and group-appropriate
     Do NOT comment on old posts
     Do NOT send DMs to 3rd degree connections
     Do NOT engage with the same person twice today

  At the end, provide a summary:
    | Group | Birthday Person | Actions Taken |
    |-------|----------------|---------------|
    | ...   | ...            | like, comment, DM |
