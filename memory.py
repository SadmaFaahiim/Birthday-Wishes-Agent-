---------
Contact Memory System for Birthday Wishes Agent.

Remembers key details about each contact from previous interactions
and uses them to craft more personal, meaningful wishes next time.

How it works:
  1. After wishing someone, saves key profile details to SQLite
  2. Next year, retrieves those details before wishing
  3. Injects the memory into the wish prompt
  4. Agent generates a wish that references last year's context

Examples:
  "Last year you were starting a new job at Google - hope it's going amazing!"
  "Hope your startup is thriving - you were so excited about it last year!"
  "It's been a year since your promotion - hope the new role is treating you well!"
