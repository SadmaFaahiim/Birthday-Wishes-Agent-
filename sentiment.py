Sentiment Analysis module for Birthday Wishes Agent.

if the sender seems sad, stressed, overwhelmed, or going
through a difficult time - and adjusts the reply accordingly.

Sentiment Types:
  - happy      : Normal, cheerful message -> standard reply
  - neutral    : Polite but flat message -> warm reply
  - sad        : Hints of sadness or difficulty -> extra caring reply
  - stressed   : Mentions work pressure, exhaustion -> supportive reply
  - lonely     : Sounds isolated or disconnected -> extra warm reply

Usage:
    from sentiment import analyze_sentiment, get_sentiment_reply

    result = await analyze_sentiment(llm, "Thanks... it's been a rough year honestly")
    # result = {"sentiment": "sad", "confidence": 0.9, "signals": ["rough year"]}

    reply = get_sentiment_reply("Rahul", result["sentiment"])

  SENTIMENT ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
  Before composing a reply, carefully read the birthday wish message
  and assess the sender's emotional state.

  STEP 1 - Detect sentiment:
     happy    : Cheerful, enthusiastic - "Happy birthday!! Hope you have an amazing day!!! "
     neutral  : Polite but flat - "Happy birthday." or "HBD"
     sad      : Hints of difficulty - "Happy birthday... it's been a rough year for me"
     stressed : Mentions busyness - "HBD! Sorry for the late wish, been crazy busy"
     lonely   : Sounds isolated - "Happy birthday, I miss everyone so much"

  STEP 2 - Choose reply tone:
    happy    -> Standard warm reply
    neutral  -> Slightly warmer, more personal
    sad      -> Extra caring, empathetic, offer support
    stressed -> Supportive, acknowledge their busyness, encourage rest
    lonely   -> Extra warm, suggest catching up, make them feel valued

  STEP 3 - Important rules:
     Never directly say "I can see you're sad" or call out their emotion
     Subtly inject warmth and care into the reply
     Keep it natural - it should feel like a genuine human response
     For sad/lonely/stressed -> add one sentence of emotional support
