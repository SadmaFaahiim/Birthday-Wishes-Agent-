LinkedIn Post Engagement module for Birthday Wishes Agent.

On someone's birthday, instead of just sending a message,
the agent also:
  1. Visits their LinkedIn profile
  2. Finds their latest post
  3. Likes the post
  4. Leaves a thoughtful, birthday-themed comment

This makes the interaction feel more genuine and increases
profile visibility and engagement.

  POST_ENGAGEMENT_ENABLED = True
