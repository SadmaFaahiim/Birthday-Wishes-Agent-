--------------
Wish Quality Scorer module for Birthday Wishes Agent.

Uses the LLM to score AI-generated birthday wishes on a scale of 1-10.
If a wish scores below the threshold, it is automatically regenerated
until a good wish is produced or the retry limit is reached.

Scoring Criteria:
  - Personalization (does it mention name/job/context?)
  - Warmth (does it feel genuine and caring?)
  - Originality (does it avoid generic phrases?)
  - Length (is it the right length - not too short, not too long?)
  - Tone (does it match the relationship type?)

Usage:
    from wish_scorer import score_wish, generate_scored_wish

    score = await score_wish(llm, wish, context)
    # score = {"score": 8, "feedback": "...", "passed": True}

    final_wish = await generate_scored_wish(llm, name, profile_info)
    # Automatically retries until score >= threshold
