----------------------
Auto Reply to Follow-up module for Birthday Wishes Agent.

When someone replies to a birthday wish or follow-up message,
this module detects the reply and responds with a natural,
AI-generated message to keep the conversation going.

How it works:
  1. Scans LinkedIn/WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook for replies
     to messages the agent previously sent
  2. Detects if the reply needs a response
  3. Generates a contextual, natural reply using the LLM
  4. Sends the reply

Reply Types:
  - Thank you reply     : "Thanks for wishing me too!"
  - Question reply      : Someone asks "How are you?"
  - Update reply        : "I just got promoted!" -> congratulate
  - Emotional reply     : Sad/stressed -> caring response
  - Short reply         : "Thanks!" -> brief warm acknowledgement

  GOAL: Find replies to birthday wishes and follow-up messages
  that we sent previously, and respond to them naturally.

  STEP 1 - Go to LinkedIn Messaging.
    Visit https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/
    Look for conversations where:
    a) WE sent the last message (birthday wish or follow-up)
    b) THEY replied AFTER our message
    c) We have NOT yet replied to their reply

  STEP 2 - For each unresponded reply (up to {remaining}):

    a) Read their reply carefully.
    b) Check the context - what did we originally send them?
    c) Assess the tone of their reply:
       - Simple thank you -> brief warm acknowledgement
       - Question ("How are you?") -> answer naturally
       - Good news (promotion, new job) -> congratulate warmly
       - Sad/stressed tone -> be extra caring and supportive
       - Short reply ("Thanks!") -> equally short response

    d) Write a SHORT, natural reply (1-2 sentences):
       - Match their energy and tone
       - Keep it conversational
       - Do NOT start every reply the same way

    e) Send the reply (or log if DRY RUN).

  STEP 3 - Stop after {remaining} replies.

  RULES:
     Only reply to messages that were replies to OUR messages
     Keep replies short and natural
     Do NOT reply to cold messages or spam
     Do NOT reply if we already responded in this thread today
     Do NOT send more than {remaining} replies today

  At the end, provide a summary:
    - Replied to: (names + their message + our reply)
    - Skipped: (count + reason)
